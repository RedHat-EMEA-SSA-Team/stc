== Gettings started with STC

To get started you will need two main things

[square]
* At least 4 VMs / hosts
* RedHat Openshift Container Platform subscription

=== Hardware requirements

These are minimal hardware requirements

[square]
* 4 vCPU
* 16 GB memory
* storage
** device 1 (for OS)
*** 20 Gb /
*** 40 Gb /var
** device 2 (for container runtime storage)
*** 40 Gb (no file system or mount needed)
** device 3 (for Openshift Container Storage)
*** 100+ Gb (no file system or mount needed)

All hosts should be identical

=== Network requirements
* at least one network device and IP address
* NetworkManager enabled
* resolvable hostnames
* Wildcard DNS A record for applications (*.apps.your.company.com)
* DNS A record for master API (master.your.company.com)
* hosts need to have access to each other (all ports or ports listed https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/prerequisites.html#required-ports[in here])
* Internet connection, direct or thru proxy
* at least one of the hosts must able to get SSL connection to all others hosts
* if firewall rules are active (e.g. on the bastion hosts), the rules must be maintained by iptables, not firewalld

* RHEL 7.4+ minimal (OS will be updated during validation phase)
* root or sudo access
* Subscriptions are allocated to systems (machines).
**  Incase it is not, we provide an helper playbook:
